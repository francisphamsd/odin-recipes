      <h1>Sweet Potato Pie</h1>
      <p>
        This recipe was shared with me by a special friend in Atlanta, GA. It
        has long been a favorite, and everyone who tastes it says it is the best
        they have ever had.

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Boil sweet potato whole in skin for 40 to 50 minutes, or until done.
          Run cold water over the sweet potato, and remove the skin.
        </li>
        <li>
          Break apart sweet potato in a bowl. Add butter, and mix well with
          mixer. Stir in sugar, milk, eggs, nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla. Beat
          on medium speed until mixture is smooth. Pour filling into an unbaked
          pie crust.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 55 to 60 minutes, or until
          knife inserted in center comes out clean. Pie will puff up like a
          souffle, and then will sink down as it cools.
